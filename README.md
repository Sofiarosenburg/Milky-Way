# Milky-Way
Here, each planet has a story to tell, and they all rotate around the Sun as you discover curious and incredible facts about them.It's a space for those who have always looked up at the sky and wanted to know more about what's out there, but in a lighthearted, beautiful way that's full of discoveries. 

# About
- The project highlights interesting facts about every planet in the Solar System, such as:
- Mercury’s extreme temperature changes;
- Venus being hotter than Mercury, even though it’s farther from the Sun;
- Earth as the only known planet with life;
- Mars and its dusty red landscapes;
- Jupiter’s huge storms and Saturn’s iconic rings;
- The icy worlds of Uranus and Neptune.
- While learning about them, you can also watch the planets moving around the Sun, giving the site a dynamic and realistic feel.

# How to Use
- Explore: Move through the Solar System and click on planets to discover fun facts.
- Learn: Read about what makes each planet special.
- Enjoy: Watch the realistic orbit animations around the Sun.
- Share: Use it as a learning tool for space lovers and students.

# Purpose
- I created this project because I love astronomy and wanted to share that passion with others.
- My goal is to show people how beautiful and fascinating the universe can be.
- I believe that learning about space isn’t just about science, it’s about curiosity, and seeing how small (and special) we are in this giant galaxy.

# Process
- The website was built in VS Code, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I used Hackatime to track the time that I spent programming, in total was 10 hours.
- I researched reliable sources for scientific facts about each planet.
- I used tutorials and AI tools just to fix minimal bugs.

# Challenges
- Making the planets orbit correctly without disappearing or breaking the layout(used AI to fix).
- Balancing realistic motion with a simple, beautiful design.
- Keeping the animations smooth and consistent across devices.

# Learnings
- I learned how to create animated and interactive elements with CSS and JavaScript(and how hard it is).
- I got to know even more about the universe while searching for fun facts.
- I practiced organizing content in a way that mixes science and creativity.
